# LaTeX Instructions

This repository uses LaTeX for typesetting documents. Below are the instructions for working with LaTeX in this repository.
All LaTeX files should use Greek language.

# Presentation

- Every presentation file should have a `.tex` extension, and the name should consist of two or three parts: `chapter`, `section`, and optionally `subsection`, with dots as separators, followed by a Greek title. Example: `1.2.3.Μονοτονία.tex` or `4.1 Πολυώνυμα.tex`.
- The Greek title follows the numbers, separated by a space.
- The `presentation.cls` file is used to define the style and structure of the presentation. Each main folder (e.g., `Α Λυκείου`, `Β Λυκείου`, `Γ Λυκείου`) contains its own `presentation.cls` for possible local customizations.
- Always use `\documentclass{presentation}` at the top of each file (do not use relative paths).
- remove `\date{}` after the institute line. The cls file handles the date automatically.
- Every presentation file should start with the following code:

  ```
  \documentclass{presentation}

  \title{<Τίτλος στα Ελληνικά>}
  \subtitle{<Υπότιτλος στα Ελληνικά>}
  \author[Λόλας]{Κωνσταντίνος Λόλας }
  \institute[$10^ο$ ΓΕΛ]{$10^ο$ ΓΕΛ Θεσσαλονίκης}
  \date{\today}

  \begin{document}

  \begin{frame}
    \titlepage
  \end{frame}
  ```

  which sets the document class to `presentation` and includes the title, subtitle, author, and institute information.

- Use `\section{Θεωρία}` before the theory frames.
- The `\begin{frame}{frame title}` and `\end{frame}` commands are used to create a new slide in the presentation.
- The title should be of a funny or interesting nature.
- The itemize environment should always be used with the `\begin{itemize}[<+->]` command to ensure that items appear one by one during the presentation.
- You may also use `\begin{enumerate}[<+->]` for numbered lists with stepwise reveal.
- For 2 or more columns, use the `\begin{multicols}{2}` command to create a two-column layout.
- Use the `block` environment (`\begin{block}{Title}` ... `\end{block}`) for definitions, theorems, or emphasis.
- Images can be included with `\includegraphics{}` (use relative paths like `images/`).
- After the theory frames, the frame `\moodle` should be used.
- `\section{Ασκήσεις}` is the command to create a new section containing exercises.
- Every exercise should be in a separate frame and should start with the command `\begin{askisi}` and end with `\end{askisi}`.
- Only `.tex` files should be edited; other files (such as `.pdf`, `.snm`, `.nav`, `.synctex.gz`) are generated and should not be modified manually.
- All content, including titles and section names, must be in Greek.
- All `.tex` files are placed directly in the grade folder (e.g., `Γ Λυκείου`), not in subfolders by topic.
- after the section "Ασκήσεις" there should be a frame with the command `\exercises` to indicate the start of exercises.
